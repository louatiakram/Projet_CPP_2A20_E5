# SmartParc

SmartParc is a C++ application with the goal of digitizing a zoo park. Through our studies, we identified a significant loss of data over time, which our application aims to solve.

## Project Overview

Our project aims to create and implement an application to manage animals, staff, visitors, products, and events. It allows adding, modifying, and deleting entities, along with other functionalities.

## Arduino Integration

SmartParc includes integration with various Arduino components to enhance functionality:
- **Distance Sensor**: Utilized for monitoring distances within the park.
- **Keypad**: Enables input through a numeric keypad.
- **LCD Display**: Displays relevant information to users.
- **Gas Leak Detector**: Ensures safety by detecting potential gas leaks within the park.

Here is the demo of our application: [SmartParc](https://youtu.be/I1HUQI1iM10?si=Tt7fjMu5Fv0UYJzF).
